The AWS Cloud Development Kit makes building infrastructure with code testable and repeatable.
Let's see how we can get started with CDK by building a simple lambda that saves data into an S3 bucket.
We'll go over creating a new CDK project, creating a lambda function, s3 bucket and giving the lambda permission to create new file in the s3 bucket.
You'll need an AWS account with an IAM user credentials setup in your terminal.

## Using the CDK command line interface (CLI)

To get the CDK code to become actual infrastructure you need to use the CDK CLI. The best way to do this with with `npx aws-cdk`,
this ensures that we always use the correct version for the project we currently working on.
I recommend setting up an alias for this, if you're using zsh (it's the default for macOS these days) you can run `zshconfig` to open your zsh config
file and then just add a new line `alias cdk=npx aws-cdk`, you'll need to restart the terminal for this to take effect.

## Create a new CDK project

Inside an empty directory run the command `cdk init sample-app --language=typescript` in your terminal to create a new CDK app with typescript.
This sample app comes with a few constructs in place as examples,
