If you're building with AWS, chances are you're gonna need a VPC. The Virtual Private Cloud
(VPC) is an essential piece of infrastructure for almost any application. A VPC allows you
to keep databases highly secure and have different (micro) services talk to each other without
general Internet access.

Setting up a VPC with the AWS cloud development kit (CDK) is very simple but, it can get complicated
getting all the details right for different types of subnets, network ACL, ingress and egress rule.
In this post we’ll go over some of the options.

Assuming you have a typescript CDK project already set up (see the post about just this here)
all we need to do is import the EC2 library and use the Vpc construct.

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib'
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-ec2'

export class MyAppVpcStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props)

    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyApp-Vpc')
  }
}
```

This is all that is required to make a new VPC but, in order to get the most out of our VPC we'll
want to define a few subnets within the VPC for use later. We'll create a public subnet for things
like load balancers that will accept incoming connections from the internet. A private subnet for
services that need to access the internet but will not allow any incoming connections from the internet.
Last of all an isolated subnet for things that are completely cut off from the internet and can only be
accessed from within the private subnet.

Here's what the CDK code for that looks like. The CIDR mask defines how many IP addresses are available
within that subnet, I.E how many services you can have within that subnet. More info on CIDR can be
found here, for now it's not too important so don’t stress over it.

```typescript
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyApp-Vpc', {
  subnetConfiguration: [
    {
      cidrMask: 24,
      name: 'Isolated',
      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_ISOLATED,
    },
    {
      cidrMask: 24,
      name: 'Private',
      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT,
    },
    {
      cidrMask: 28,
      name: 'Public',
      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,
    },
  ],
})
const privateSubnets = vpc.selectSubnets({
  subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT,
})

const publicSubnets = vpc.selectSubnets({
  subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,
})

const isolatedSubnets = vpc.selectSubnets({
  subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_ISOLATED,
})
```

Each of these subnets comes with a default network ACL (Access Control List) that allow internet
traffic. We want to use a custom network ACL for our isolated subnet to ensure it can only be accessed
from our private subnet. This is done in CDK like so.

```typescript
const nacl = new ec2.NetworkAcl(this, 'MyApp-NetworkAcl', {
  vpc,
  networkAclName: 'IsolatedSubnetNACL',
  subnetSelection: isolatedSubnets,
})
```

Now that the network ACL is set up we just need to add ingress and egress rules to allow access
from the private subnet. Even though we only have one private subnet, when we select it the returned
value is an array so we need to use a forEach to get the individual subnet.

```typescript
privateSubnets.subnets.forEach((subnet, index) => {
  nacl.addEntry(`PrivateSubnets${index}Ingress`, {
    cidr: ec2.AclCidr.ipv4(subnet.ipv4CidrBlock),
    direction: ec2.TrafficDirection.INGRESS,
    ruleNumber: 100 + index,
    traffic: ec2.AclTraffic.allTraffic(),
  })

  nacl.addEntry(`PrivateSubnets${index}Egress`, {
    cidr: ec2.AclCidr.ipv4(subnet.ipv4CidrBlock),
    direction: ec2.TrafficDirection.EGRESS,
    ruleNumber: 100 + index,
    traffic: ec2.AclTraffic.allTraffic(),
  })
})
```

There are a few more params we want to specify on the main VPC construct to get everything setup
correctly. We will need a NAT gateway that manages access to the internet for the VPC. Bear in
mind this has a cost of $40 a month. We'll also set up a CIDR range for the VPC and give it two
availability zones for redundancy in case one zone goes down.

```typescript
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyApp-Vpc', {
  ...
  cidr: '10.0.0.0/16',
  maxAzs: 2,
  natGateways: 1,
})
```

The last thing that we want to do is output the Vpc ID and CIDR to cloudformation and store it in the
Systems Manager parameter store for easy access later.

```typescript
import * as ssm from '@aws-cdk/aws-ssm';

...

new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'VpcId', {
  description: 'VPC ID',
  exportName: `vpc-id`,
  value: vpc.vpcId,
})

new ssm.StringParameter(this, 'ssmVpcId', {
  parameterName: `${ssmPrefix}/vpc/vpc-id`,
  stringValue: vpc.vpcId,
})


new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'VpcCidr', {
  description: 'VPC CIDR',
  exportName: `vpc-cidr`,
  value: vpc.vpcCidrBlock,
})

new ssm.StringParameter(this, 'ssmVpcId', {
  parameterName: `${ssmPrefix}/vpc/vpc-id`,
  stringValue: vpc.vpcId,
})
```

Here’s how this looks when it’s all put together. There are a few changes from the examples above
to reuse some code.

```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core'
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-ec2'
import * as ssm from '@aws-cdk/aws-ssm'

export class MyAppVpcStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props)

    const projectPrefix = 'development'
    const ssmPrefix = `/myAppProject/${projectPrefix}/network`
    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyApp-Vpc', {
      cidr: `10.0.0.0/16`,
      maxAzs: 2,
      natGateways: 1,
      subnetConfiguration: [
        {
          cidrMask: 24,
          name: 'Isolated',
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_ISOLATED,
        },
        {
          cidrMask: 24,
          name: 'Private',
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT,
        },
        {
          cidrMask: 28,
          name: 'Public',
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,
        },
      ],
    })

    const privateSubnets = vpc.selectSubnets({
      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT,
    })

    const publicSubnets = vpc.selectSubnets({
      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,
    })

    const isolatedSubnets = vpc.selectSubnets({
      subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_ISOLATED,
    })

    const nacl = new ec2.NetworkAcl(this, 'MyApp-NetworkAcl', {
      vpc,
      networkAclName: 'IsolatedSubnetNACL',
      subnetSelection: isolatedSubnets,
    })

    privateSubnets.subnets.forEach((subnet, index) => {
      nacl.addEntry(`PrivateSubnets${index}Ingress`, {
        cidr: ec2.AclCidr.ipv4(subnet.ipv4CidrBlock),
        direction: ec2.TrafficDirection.INGRESS,
        ruleNumber: 100 + index,
        traffic: ec2.AclTraffic.allTraffic(),
      })

      nacl.addEntry(`PrivateSubnets${index}Egress`, {
        cidr: ec2.AclCidr.ipv4(subnet.ipv4CidrBlock),
        direction: ec2.TrafficDirection.EGRESS,
        ruleNumber: 100 + index,
        traffic: ec2.AclTraffic.allTraffic(),
      })
    })

    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'VpcId', {
      description: 'VPC ID',
      exportName: 'vpc-id',
      value: vpc.vpcId,
    })

    new ssm.StringParameter(this, 'ssmVpcId', {
      parameterName: `${ssmPrefix}/vpc/vpc-id`,
      stringValue: vpc.vpcId,
    })

    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'VpcCidr', {
      description: 'VPC CIDR',
      exportName: `vpc-cidr`,
      value: vpc.vpcCidrBlock,
    })

    new ssm.StringParameter(this, 'ssmVpcId', {
      parameterName: `${ssmPrefix}/vpc/vpc-id`,
      stringValue: vpc.vpcId,
    })
  }
}
```
